Crawl Rate Tracker 2
====================

An updated version of [Crawl Rate Tracker](http://www.blogstorm.co.uk/wordpress-crawl-rate-tracker/) with support for Multisite and a bit better filtering.

This is a work in progress.

TODO
----

1. Add a network admin page
2. Clean up database functions
3. Support sortable columns in the WP_List_Table
4. Figure out possible issues with using a bunch of `time()` and `strtotime()` calls.  Eg. time zone?
